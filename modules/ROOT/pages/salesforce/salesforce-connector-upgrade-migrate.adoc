== Supported Upgrade Paths

[%header,cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|From Version | To Version
|9.8.x |10.0.0
|===

== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* Removed deprecated connection providers
* Merged multiple operations in one
* Replay ID functionality re-designed
* Mule TLSContext's usage
* Dozer library removal
* Improved error types


== Changes in Connection Providers

In matter of connection providers, this release contains the following changes:

* Removed the deprecated connection providers (the ones that were using pooling connection) from the previous version.
* Added new tabs in Salesforce Config and reordered the parameters in a more intuitive way.
* Added Connection Pool Config tab to improve multi-threading support while running operations. This contains 3 parameters that
help the user manage the connection objects of the application.
* Read timeout parameter was removed from the provider's configuration and now it can be find in the connector's
configuration. It has a default value of 0 seconds, which means infinite, and it can be overridden in any operation via
the Advanced tab.
* Some parameters were removed: _Advanced reconnection params_,
_Assigment rule id_,
_Client id_,
_Time object store_,
_Batch SObject max depth_,
_Disable session invalidation_,
_Allow field truncation support_,
_Use default rule_,
_Can clear fields by updating field value to null_.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
. Install Zuora AQuA Connector to replace the AQuA operations that were previously included in Zuora Connector 4.2.x:
.. In Studio, create a Mule project.
.. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
.. In Add Modules to Project, type 'Zuora AQuA' in the search field.
.. In Available modules, select *Zuora AQuA Connector*, and then click *Add*.
.. Click *Finish*.
.. Verify that the `zuora-aqua-connector` dependency version is `1.0.0` in the pom.xml. +
Anypoint Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade to Salesforce 10 Connector:

.. In Studio, create a Mule project.
.. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
.. In Add Modules to Project, type 'Salesforce 10' in the search field.
.. In Available modules, select *Salesforce 10 Connector*, and then click *Add*.
.. Click *Finish*.
.. Verify that the `salesforce-connector` dependency version is `10.0.0` in the pom.xml.

Anypoint Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project pom.xml and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Anypoint Studio.

== Reverting the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Salesforce Connector, change the `salesforce-connector` dependency version `10.0.0` in the project's pom.xml to the previous version.

You must update the project's pom.xml in Anypoint Studio.
