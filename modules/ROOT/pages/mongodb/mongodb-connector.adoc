== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine (Mule) extensions that enable you to connect to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, MongoDB, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the MongoDB target resource and Anypoint Platform. You must also understand how to create a Mule app using Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

To use the this connector you need:

* MongoDB instance
* Set of valid credentials, including the required MongoDB endpoints, pointing to your instance


== Audience

* Starting user -- To create your Mule app, see 
xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center] or 
xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio]. 
* Power user - Read xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support]
and xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-examples.adoc[Examples].

== Exchange Example

https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] provides a MongoDB example
