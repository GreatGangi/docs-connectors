Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see the xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-reference.adoc[MongoDB Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click the name of the trigger card.
. If you are using the MongoDB connector as an input source trigger, use Object Listener operation.

Alternatively, you can trigger your app using the HTTP Listener or the Scheduler.

If you are using the MongoDB connector as a trigger, refer to these reference section:

+ xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-reference.adoc#object-listener[Object Listener]

Design Center automatically saves changes you make in a session.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the connector name. 
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Enter the required values in the *General* tab.
. If needed, enter values for other tabs.
. Specify access information to the connector resource.
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure you have access to MongoDB.
