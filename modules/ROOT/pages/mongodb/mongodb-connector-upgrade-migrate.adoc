== Changes in Operations Metadata
The version 5.x of the connector has a way to generate operations metadata, if the user provides a set of documents per collection to take attributes from.

The new connector will provide metadata based on the latest document in each collection automatically.

=== Metadata in MongoDB v6.0

[%header,cols="34%,33%,33%"]
|===
|Operation Name	| Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| Insert Document
2+|* Document: resolved dynamically based on the selected value on the collection parameter. It will read the latest document of the given collection, take its structure and use it as I/O metadata.

| Insert Documents
2+|* Document: resolved dynamically based on the selected value on the collection parameter. It will read the latest document of the given collection, take its structure and use it as I/O metadata.

| Update Documents
| N/A
| JSON that contains the following structure: { "matched" : int, "modified" : int, upsertedId: JSON }

| Remove Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Count Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Find Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value on the collection parameter. It will read the first document of the given collection, take its structure and use it.

| Create File
| N/A
a|** A GridFS JSON object with the following structure:
* JSON Id
* String fileName
* Long Length
* Int ChunkSize
* Datetime uploadDate
* JSON Metadata

| Find Files
| N/A
a|** List<InputStream> Each InputStream will be a GridFS JSON object with the following attributes:
* JSON Id
* String fileName
* Long Length
* Int ChunkSize
* Datetime uploadDate
* JSON Metadata

== Removed operations in MongoDB Connector v6.0.0

Ten operations were removed in MongoDB connector v6.0.0

[%header,cols="15%,35%,15%,35%"]
|===
2+|Removed from MongoDB 5.x 2+| Can be reproduced in MongoDB 6.0.0 through
|Name	| Description	|Name	|Description
|Incremental dump | Executes an incremental dump of the database | Dump | Incremental dump functionality can be reproduced with Dump operation
|Restore | Takes the output from the dump and restores it | Restore from file / Restore from directory | These operations take the output from the dump file/directory respectively and restore it
|Update documents by function | Update documents using a Mongo function | N/A | N/A
|Update documents by functions | Update documents using one or more Mongo functions | N/A | N/A
|Find one and update document | Finds and updates the first document that matches a given query | N/A | This operation's functionality can be reproduced by combining other operations
|Save document | Inserts or updates a document based on its object ID | N/A | N/A
|Find one document | Finds the first document that matches a given query | Find documents | Specifying Limit=1, this operation will return one document
|Execute generic command | Executes a generic command on the database | Execute command | Executes a command on the database
|List files | Lists all the files that match the given query and sorts them by filename | N/A | N/A
|Find one file | Answers the first file that matches the given query | Find files | Giving a specific file to the query, this operation's behaviour can be reproduced

=== Changes in Operation Names

Some of the Operation names are updated:

[%header]
|===
|5.3.x|6.0.0
|Map reduce objects |Map reduce
|Exists collection |Collection exists
|List indices |List indexes

== Changes in Sources
In this new version of the connector there is only one type of source: the Object Listener, that retrieves all the documents that were created and belong to a certain collection.

The Delete and Update Sources existing in the previous version of the connector were removed.

=== Metadata in Object Listener

[%header,cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| N/A
| It will resolve output metadata dynamically based on the selected value on the collection name parameter. It will read the last document of the given collection, take its structure and use it as output metadata.
|===

== Changes in Connection types
The Connection String type was removed in this version, now there is only one Generic Connection.
